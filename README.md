# Opencraft 2
Opencraft 2 is an Minecraft-like online game built in Unity. It is intended for supporting experimental research on
online game and cloud gaming performance. 
## Setup
Install *Unity 2022 LTS*, clone this repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules`, and open it in Unity. 
Unity should automatically install required packages. This includes the [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) package,
which is useful for testing multiplayer functionality in-editor.
The [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) IDE is recommended, it has direct integration with Unity.

The game can be started from `Scenes/MainScene`. To run select `Server & Client` in `Multiplayer -> Window: PlayMode Tools`,
then press the play button. Additional configuration can be specified in command line arguments, 
which can be set in-editor on the `Editor Args` field of the `GameBootstrap -> Editor Cmd Args` singleton component.

## Builds
Opencraft 2 is built by the Unity editor, using `File -> Build Settings` with `Platform` set to `Windows, Mac, Linux` and
`Target Platform` set to `Linux` or `Windows` (Mac is untested). For debugging, analysis, and metric collection the `Development Build`
flag must be set. The builds folder is location under `./Builds/`. This folder also contains the Docker files for containerizing Opencraft 2.

## Contributing
See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for contribution guidelines and workflow.

### Docker
Opencraft 2 can be run as a container. The main game container can be built from the `./Builds/` folder using 
`docker build -t jerriteic/opencraft2:base .`. This base image depends on `jerriteic/gpu_ubuntu20.04` which allows
container application to run graphics applications with NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration. That container can 
be built in the same folder using the `Dockerfile.ubuntugpu` dockerfile.

#### Docker Requirements
The game container runs a hardware-accelerated 3D graphics application through VirtualGL. 
This requires extensive configuration to the host platform:
1. Install correct NVIDIA drivers for your platform and GPU.
   1. Container is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 on NVIDIA Tesla T4 with proprietary driver version 535. 
2. Install [Docker + NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#docker)
3. On headless hosts, configure display settings according to [this guide](https://github.com/trn84/recipe-wizard/blob/master/nvidia-headless.md). 
   1. Do not reinstall the NVIDIA drivers, skip the step marked `Install NVIDIA Driver from CUDA .run shell script`.

#### Running the Container
If the Docker requirements are met, run the container using the following command:
```
docker run \
--runtime=nvidia \
--name=opencraft_gpu \
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
--init \
--net=host \
--privileged=true \
--rm=false \
-e DISPLAY=:0 \
-v /tmp/.X11-unix/X0:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0:ro \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
-v ./logs/:/opencraft2/logs/ \
jerriteic/opencraft2:base \
./opencraft2.x86_64 -logFile ./logs/opencraft2_log.txt
```
> [!WARNING]
> Running Docker containers with these flags gives them **UNRESTRICTED HOST ROOT ACCESS**! Act accordingly.

## Parrelsync
[ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) allows synchronizing multiple copies of a Unity project. These
can be run in parallel to test networked functionality. In `ParrelSync -> Preferences`, make sure that `/UnityRenderStreaming`
is listed under `Optional Folders to Symbolically Link`. Then, to create a new ParrelSync clone select `Add new clone` in `ParrelSync -> Clones Manager`.

## Multiplay
This project supports a single game client acting as a streamed gaming host for many players on guest clients.  
Testing Multiplay is easiest using ParrelSync, in the clone's launch arguments in the clone manager add `-multiplayRole Guest`
to run it as a Multiplay guest client.

### Signalling Service WebApp
Multiplay functionality requires a signalling service to establish a direct connection between host and guest clients.
The signaling service is run as a webapp, the source is available in `./UnityRenderStreaming/WebApp/` 
and can be build using `./UnityRenderStreaming/pack_webapp.sh` which has `npm` as a dependency. 
The webapp can be run with a convenience script `.Builds/Multiplay_WebApp/start.sh` or directly with `.\webserver -p <PORT>`.
The port the webserver listens on must be the same as the signaling port configured using the
application command line argument `-signalingPort <int>`. 


## Debugging and Analysis
Inspecting existing entities, components, systems, and queries in each existing world can be done using
Entities information pages under `Window -> Entities`. Information not specific to ECS can be found under `Window -> Analysis`,
with the `Profiler` being particularly important for determining performance impact of various changes.
Burst compiled generated code can be viewed in `Jobs -> Burst -> Open Inspector`, though this is mainly useful for low level optimization work.
Multiplayer functionality and behaviour can be visualized using the `Window -> Multiplayer -> Window: NetDbg (Browser)` tool,
which automatically gathers state snapshot metrics from Netcode for Entities connections.

If your Unity or your IDE starts giving strange errors, particularly about packages,
it is worth trying `Edit > Preferences -> External Tools -> Regenerate project files`. As a last resort, `Reimport All`
through the right-click menu in the `Project` window.

## Configuration and Parameters
The Opencraft 2 application can be configured in a variety of ways, with some methods being different in-editor and
when run standalone. In editor, the hierarchy of configuration is `Deployment Graph`>`Multiplayer PlayMode Tools` >`Editor Args`.

### Deployment Configuration
The deployment service constructs a deployment graph based on a configuration file. The deployment configuration file path is set
using the command line argument `-deploymentJson <FilePath>`. In editor, a json file can be set on the `Deployment Config` field of the `GameBootstrap->Cmd Args Reader` singleton component.
The Json is expected to follow this formatting (excluding comments):
```
{
"nodes":[
   {
      "nodeID":0,                                 // ID of this node
      "nodeIP":"127.0.0.1",                       // Expected IP of this node, will throw warning if node with nodeID not at this IP.
      "worldConfigs":[                            // List of worlds to deploy on this node

## Opencraft2-VR

Opencraft can be run in VR (Meta Quest 2 & 3 & pro over OVR), ensure the following things are set up:
 * switch PolkaDOTS branch to VR-properly
 * open the Assets/Scenes/MainScene and in the PolkaDOTS frontend object, make 
 sure that the player prefab is set to multiplayPlayerOVR, you can find this prefab in
 /Packages/PolkaDOTS/Prefab/Player
 * Open build settings and switch build target to Android
 * in build settings go to playersettings->XR-plugin management and make sure
 Oculus is selected under the Android tab.
 * in build settings go to playersettings->Meta_XR and do what it sais
 * configure /Assets/Resources/cmdArgs.json and /Assets/Resources/deployment.json
 * connect your Meta Quest headset to ADB 
 * press build and pray I did not forget anything
 * go get a coffee or smth idk
 * open cmd and ```adb install ./YOURBUILDHERE.apk``` (replace filename with proper things)
 * on MQ3, click all apps, top right filter on uknown sources and Opencraft should be there
